# Advent of Code solved in Golang

Inspiration for graph algorithm of day 6 [https://github.com/APMorto/aoc2024/tree/master](https://github.com/APMorto/aoc2024/tree/master)

## To explore

-   Day 6 - Part 2: Speed up with Go channels
-   Day 7 - Part 1: Improve with generators for combinations
-   Day 16 - Learn Dijkstra
-   Day 18 - Learned DFS with a queue
-   Day 19 - Learned to stick to strings when working with combinatorics, numbers can get high
    -   To find every combination, put the return outside the for-loop
    -   Cache a recursive function after the recursive call mapping input to its result.
